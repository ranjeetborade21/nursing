          <p>It gives me immense pleasure that Shri Sai School Of Nursing, Umred is a premier institution of Maharashtra. To promote quality education in nursing stream, we open  Shri Sai School Of Nursing in 2010 with the affiliation of Maharashtra Nursing Council. I am happy to state that right from its inception, it has been striving to serve the cause for which it has been set up. Our thanks are to its Principal, faculty members and students for the success it has been achieving. In the period of 10 years, the college has earned a place of pride by virtue of its dedicated scholarly pursuits. 

            Since its inception, the institution has challenged itself to achieve more than is expected. It has been setting benchmarks of unparalleled success without compromising on quality and value based education in nursing streams.         
            The fame of the institution can be measure from the fact that maximum students are not only from Nagpur district but also from other districts of Maharashtra state.
             
            Overall development of the individual is the goal of education and we all have to ensure that there is no stone left unturned to equip the student of today for the challenges of life.
             
            Let us hope and wish that the College will take on a new identity as a landmark in the socio-cultural map of India.
             
            I wish the Principal, staff and students of the college all success in their endeavours.</p>

            Only nurses hold the unique understanding and in-depth knowledge about a patient’s history, diagnosis, health care needs, personal worries and the concerns of a patient’s family and friends. It is the nurse who knows and understands all the details that are required to administer care to the patients and not the health care policy makers, the politicians, the funders, the economists or even our colleagues in health care, doctors, social workers or physiotherapists. As nurses you need to recognise this is informational power, which is unique to nurses and You have a duty to your patients to use this power in every conversation about health care.
            You can continually strive to build a better nursing environment where nurses can safely provide the best standard of care for patients. You can and must be at every table to influence health policy and it is only by working all together that you will achieve our goal.
